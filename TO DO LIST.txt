TO DO:
- Find trained llm model for email security and detection
- Implement model and test to see if it will detect suspicious email
- Integrate file scanning with virus total api
- Integrate email search off databases, and other security api/websites (virustotal might do some already) and fill the rest of the meatadata on investigation page
- Implement RAG if not already for the graph
- Vector each user so we can have behavorial detection
- Research any other techniques to improve graph/ai/llm
- Final touches/missing stuff (UI, specific features, etc)
